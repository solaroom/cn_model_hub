# Local Development

This setup runs the KohakuHub backend locally in your Python virtualenv, while Docker provides the supporting services:

- PostgreSQL for application metadata
- MinIO for local S3-compatible storage
- LakeFS for repository versioning
- Vite dev servers for the main UI and admin UI

It does not require `docker compose`. The scripts below use plain `docker`.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Engine
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- An existing virtualenv for backend work

## One-Time Setup

If you prefer a single command surface, run `make help` from the repo root to see the shortcuts below.

### 1. Backend dependencies

```bash
./venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

If you already activated the virtualenv:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### 2. Frontend dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Create your local env file

```bash
cp .env.dev.example .env.dev
```

Or:

```bash
make init-env
```

The defaults are already wired to the local Docker services and Vite dev servers.

## Start Local Infra

```bash
./scripts/dev/up_infra.sh
```

Or:

```bash
make infra-up
```

This starts:

- Postgres on `127.0.0.1:25432`
- MinIO API on `127.0.0.1:29001`
- MinIO console on `127.0.0.1:29000`
- LakeFS on `127.0.0.1:28000`

Persistent dev data is stored under `hub-meta/dev/`.

### MinIO CORS (required for in-browser preview)

The pure-client safetensors / parquet preview (issue #27) issues cross-origin
HTTP `Range` reads against the presigned S3 URL that `/resolve/` 302s to.
Browsers will block those reads unless MinIO advertises CORS.

`up_infra.sh` already passes `MINIO_API_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN=*` to the MinIO
container by default, which is what both the Vite dev origin
(`http://127.0.0.1:28300`) and production deploys need. Override it with the
`DEV_MINIO_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN` variable in `.env.dev` if you want to restrict
it to a specific origin (the value is forwarded verbatim as
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`; comma-separated origins also work).

If you already have a MinIO container from before this change, recreate it
so the env var lands:

```bash
docker rm -f kohakuhub-dev-minio
./scripts/dev/up_infra.sh
```

Smoke-test the CORS response (should include
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` and `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET`):

```bash
curl -i -X OPTIONS http://127.0.0.1:29001/hub-storage \
     -H 'Origin: http://127.0.0.1:28300' \
     -H 'Access-Control-Request-Method: GET'
```

Without this, the preview modal opens, shows its spinner, then surfaces a
browser-level CORS error instead of the parsed metadata. Downloads via
`hf_hub_download` / direct `/resolve/` hits are unaffected — only the
cross-origin Range probe the SPA does breaks.

## Start The Backend

```bash
./scripts/dev/run_backend.sh
```

Or:

```bash
make backend
```

What this script does:

- loads `.env.dev`
- initializes LakeFS on first run
- writes LakeFS credentials to `hub-meta/dev/lakefs/credentials.env`
- runs database migrations
- auto-seeds fixed demo users/orgs/repos on a fresh local environment when `KOHAKU_HUB_DEV_AUTO_SEED=true`
- starts `uvicorn` with `--reload` on `127.0.0.1:48888`

Swagger docs will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:48888/docs`.

If you want the migrations + demo seed without holding the terminal open for `uvicorn`, run:

```bash
make seed-demo
```

This writes a local manifest to `hub-meta/dev/demo-seed-manifest.json`.

## Start The Frontends

Main UI:

```bash
pnpm run dev:ui
```

Or:

```bash
make ui
```

Admin UI:

```bash
pnpm run dev:admin
```

Or:

```bash
make admin
```

Access:

- Main UI: `http://127.0.0.1:5173`
- Admin UI: `http://127.0.0.1:5174`

The Vite configs already proxy API traffic to the backend at `127.0.0.1:48888`.

## Why `KOHAKU_HUB_INTERNAL_BASE_URL` Exists

For local development, the backend should generate public links that point to the main UI dev server (`5173`), but its own internal follow-up requests should still hit the backend directly (`48888`).

Set in `.env.dev`:

```bash
KOHAKU_HUB_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5173
KOHAKU_HUB_INTERNAL_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:48888
```

This keeps:

- browser-facing links on the frontend dev server
- backend self-calls off the Vite proxy path

## First Login / Admin

Main UI seeded account:

- Username: `mai_lin`
- Password: `KohakuDev123!`

Additional seeded users use the same password:

- `leo_park`
- `sara_chen`
- `noah_kim`
- `ivy_ops`

The seeded data also includes fixed organizations and repositories, including public/private repos, model/dataset/space types, branches, tags, likes, LFS files, and dataset preview files.

Admin UI login does not use a username/password. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5174` and use the token from `.env.dev`.

Default local token:

```bash
KOHAKU_HUB_ADMIN_SECRET_TOKEN=dev-admin-token-change-me
```

## Common Commands

Restart infra:

```bash
./scripts/dev/down_infra.sh
./scripts/dev/up_infra.sh
```

Or:

```bash
make infra-down
make infra-up
```

Stop infra only:

```bash
./scripts/dev/down_infra.sh
```

Or:

```bash
make infra-down
```

Tail a container log:

```bash
docker logs -f kohakuhub-dev-lakefs
docker logs -f kohakuhub-dev-minio
docker logs -f kohakuhub-dev-postgres
```

## Backend Tests

Backend tests run against the real Postgres, MinIO, and LakeFS services. The same `make test` entrypoint is used locally and in GitHub Actions.

Start the local infra first:

```bash
make infra-up
```

Run the full backend suite with coverage:

```bash
make test
```

Run only one backend submodule by passing a path relative to both `test/kohakuhub/` and `src/kohakuhub/`:

```bash
make test RANGE_DIR=api
make test RANGE_DIR=api/repo/routers
```

When `RANGE_DIR` is set, pytest runs `test/kohakuhub/${RANGE_DIR}` and coverage focuses on `src/kohakuhub/${RANGE_DIR}`.

If you keep local test overrides in a repo-root `.env`, load them into your shell before running tests:

```bash
source .env
make test
```

The test code reads environment variables only. It does not load `.env` directly.

## Reset Local Data

`make reset-local-data` is intentionally destructive. The script prints a bold red warning, explains the consequences, and asks for a single `y/N` confirmation before it clears the local app state through the in-process local reset helper.

The reset flow no longer deletes `hub-meta/dev/` directly. Instead, it:

- deletes all LakeFS repositories through the local LakeFS API
- clears the configured S3 bucket through the storage client
- rebuilds the KohakuHub application schema
- removes the local demo seed manifest

This avoids Docker bind-mount ownership issues and keeps the local infra containers running so you can re-seed immediately.

If you want a clean local reset followed by fresh demo data bootstrapping:

```bash
make reset-and-seed
```

That command still goes through the same single `y/N` confirmation before anything is deleted.

## Troubleshooting

### Docker service ports are already taken

Adjust the port mappings inside [`scripts/dev/up_infra.sh`](/home/zhangshaoang/wtf-projects/KohakuHub/scripts/dev/up_infra.sh) and keep `.env.dev` in sync.

### LakeFS says it is already initialized but credentials are missing

The bootstrap credentials are only returned once. If `hub-meta/dev/lakefs-data/` still exists but `hub-meta/dev/lakefs/credentials.env` was removed, either:

- restore the credentials file, or
- delete `hub-meta/dev/lakefs-data/` and initialize again

### Backend cannot connect to Postgres

Check:

```bash
docker logs kohakuhub-dev-postgres
cat .env.dev
```

Make sure `KOHAKU_HUB_DATABASE_URL` matches `DEV_POSTGRES_*`.
