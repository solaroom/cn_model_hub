"""Contract tests for Hugging Face Hub features KohakuHub explicitly does not
support.

These surfaces appear in the PR #18 compatibility matrix as "Not Supported /
Not Claimed": Space runtime management, Collections, and Webhooks.
Gradio / datasets / transformers can probe these
endpoints during deploy / load flows, so the *shape* of the "no" matters:

* HTTP 501 (not 404 / 500) so the intent is readable on the wire.
* ``X-Error-Code: NotImplemented`` so downstream observability and error
  dashboards can bucket these consistently rather than mixing them with
  real bugs.
* ``X-Error-Message`` with a concrete, actionable explanation — this is
  what ends up inside the ``HfHubHTTPError`` the user sees.
* ``X-Request-Id`` for correlation with backend logs (the middleware applies
  to every response, including these).

Any regression here is a compat-UX regression: the user still gets "your
request failed", but loses the "because KohakuHub intentionally does not
implement feature X" hint.

This module also verifies the *client-visible* half of the contract: when
the user calls `huggingface_hub.HfApi.restart_space(...)` etc. against
KohakuHub, the traceback they get must contain our `X-Error-Message`
verbatim. Without that, the raw HTTP 501 is indistinguishable from a
network glitch.
